#Flicker Fusion Threshold Assignment Project Report

##1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to construct a prototype of an embedded system to determine the frequency of a person's subjective flicker fusion threshold. "The flicker fusion threshold, or flicker fusion rate, is a concept in the psychophysics of vision. It is defined as the frequency at which an intermittent light stimulus appears to be completely steady to the average human observer" (Wikipedia, 2003).
